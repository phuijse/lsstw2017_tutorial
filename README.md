# lsstw2017_tutorial
Tutorial presented at the LSST Workshop 2017, Santiago, Chile

This tutorial is on the discrimination of RR Lyrae light curves from the VVV survey data. The following topics are covered

1. Periodicity detection in light curves using mutual information (P4J)
2. Feature extraction using Gaussian proccesses (scikit-learn)
3. Dimensionality reduction using PCA (scikit-learn) and autoencoders (tensorflow)
4. Interactive visualization of the reduced feature space using bokeh
5. Transductive classification using a positive-unlabeled (PU) random forest
